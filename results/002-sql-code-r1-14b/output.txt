Okay, so I've got this SQL query here that's pretty long and complicated. Let me try to understand what it does step by step.

First, looking at the code, I see that it starts with three separate Common Table Expressions (CTEs): chupok_state, lls_state, and pok_state. Each of these seems to be dealing with different brands: CHU, LLS, and POK respectively. They all have similar structures but are pulling from different tables based on the brand.

For example, chupok_state is selecting from V_ACCOUNT_CONTACT_ADDRESS in CHU_PROD and POK_PROD databases. It's looking at address types like CDD, SDD, and Billing (Bank), assigning them ranks where CDD is most trusted, then SDD, etc. The query seems to be getting the latest state information for each account based on these rankings.

Then there's lls_state which selects from V_IDENTITY_LOGIN in LLS_PROD, focusing on GEO_LOCATION_SUBDIVISION_CODE as the state. It's using ROW_NUMBER to get the most recent login timestamp.

The next part is a union of these three states into player_state, combining all brands together with their respective states and brand codes.

After that, there are CTEs for chupok_winner, lls_winner, and pok_winner. These seem to be pulling winner information from different sources again based on the brand. They include fields like user ID, play date, game name, etc.

Then, all_winners is a union of these three winner tables, combining winners across all brands into one dataset.

Distinct_winners selects unique user IDs and their corresponding brand codes from all_winners to avoid duplicates.

Finally, the main query joins player_state with all_winners on user ID and brand code, selecting the required fields. It seems like this is intended to enrich the winner data with state information based on where the user is located.

I think the overall goal here is to aggregate information about winners from different games (CHU, LLS, POK), get their latest states, and combine it all into a single result set.

Wait, but I notice that in the player_state CTE, when combining chupok_state and lls_state with union all, maybe there's an issue because each might have the same brand codes. But no, CHU is 'CHU', LLS is 'LLS', and POK is 'POK', so they shouldn't conflict.

Also, in the final main query, it uses "winners_final" as a CTE that seems to be joining all_winners with player_state. Then it selects from winners_final.

I'm a bit confused about why there are multiple layers of CTEs here. It might be for clarity and to break down the problem into manageable parts.

One thing I'm concerned about is whether all the joins are correctly matching on user_id and brand_code, ensuring that each winner gets the correct state information. Also, if a user doesn't have any state information in player_state, it would show as null, which might be acceptable depending on business rules.

I also wonder about performance. With so many CTEs and unions, this could get complicated and potentially slow if not optimized properly. Maybe there are indexes missing or some subqueries that can be simplified.

Another thought: the brand codes are hardcoded in each part. If a new brand is added, someone would have to update all these places, which isn't ideal. Perhaps a more dynamic approach would be better.

In summary, this query seems to be pulling together winner data from different sources, enriching it with state information based on where the user is located, and then presenting it in a unified format. But I need to make sure that each join condition is correct and that there are no missing or duplicated records.

The provided SQL script is designed to aggregate and analyze winner data across multiple brands (CHU, LLS, POK) while enriching it with player state information based on their location. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

### Key Components:
1. **Player State Data**:
   - **chupok_state**: Retrieves the most trusted state (CDD > SDD > Billing) for CHU and POK users from their address records.
   - **lls_state**: Fetches the latest GEO_LOCATION_SUBDIVISION_CODE for LLS users based on login timestamps.
   - **player_state**: Combines state information from all brands into a single dataset.

2. **Winner Data**:
   - **chupok_winner**, **lls_winner**, and **pok_winner**: Pull winner details specific to each brand, including user ID, play date, game name, etc.
   - **all_winners**: Aggregates winners from all brands into a unified view.

3. **Distinct Winners**:
   - Extracts unique users who have won across any of the brands to avoid duplication.

4. **Final Query**:
   - Joins `player_state` with `all_winners` to merge state information with winner data, ensuring each record includes relevant details like brand code and state.

### Functionality:
- **Data Aggregation**: Combines winner data from different sources into a single result set.
- **State Enrichment**: Adds location-based state information to each winner record for insights on regional performance.
- **Efficiency Considerations**: Uses CTEs to modularize the query, enhancing readability and maintainability. However, it's essential to monitor performance for large datasets due to multiple joins and unions.

### Usage:
This script is useful for analyzing game winners across different brands, understanding their geographical distribution, and making data-driven decisions based on regional trends or promotions.

**Note**: Ensure that all necessary indexes are in place to optimize query performance. Additionally, consider future-proofing the code by implementing a dynamic approach for new brands rather than hardcoding each one.
